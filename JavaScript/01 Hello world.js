console.log("Hello world");
console.log("This is my first program of javascript");
console.log("Trust me its very easy");


// ; is optional 
// but its good programming practise to use semicolan ( ; ) after every single statement 

// console.log() is used to display whatever you want to show in console 
// if we want to print "Hello world" so we need to wrote "console.log("Hello world");"
